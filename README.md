After performing the above experimentation using the all four algorithms which are
CNN, VGG, Xception, and ResNet the results obtained are 76.53% 67.72% 92.87%
and 72.37% accuracy respectively. Xception outperformed the rest of the algorithms in
almost all aspects. It can be seen that Xception has achieved the best results with
accuracy of 92.87% and AUC Score of 90.58%, and recall of 93%. Therefore, based
on this comparative study it can be concluded that the Xception algorithm can be used
for better image classification of skin lesions to detect skin cancer between target
classes
